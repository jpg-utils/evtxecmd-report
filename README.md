This is a powershell script designed to take the output of Eric Zimmerman's Evtxcmd tool and generate an HTML report showing logins, logouts, and suspicious account activity found on a standalone Windows Machine.

This script is NOT designed to be a catch-all on a system for finding suspicious activity. It is a starting point, not a panacea. Ultimately it falls onto the owner of the system what qualifies as "suspicious activity."
